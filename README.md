Creating a new repository
My name is Marc Molina, I am 23 years old, I am working as a chef but I am really interested in to learn about coding, I have always felt passionate about it and has always been interested in tech and I think that throught C&F I can finally learn and became a web-developer, being able to move on in to that field. 
I am also passionate about sport, I've been playing football since I was 4.

Tonight I will be working on my restaurant, where I wil shuck around 200 oyster in order to satisfy the customers.
