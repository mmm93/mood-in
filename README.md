My name is Marc Molina, I am 23 years old, I am working as a chef but I am really interested in to learn about coding, I have always felt passionate about it and has always been interested in tech and I think that throught C&F I can finally learn and became a web-developer, being able to move on in to that field. 
I am also passionate about sport, I've been playing football since I was 4.

I am actually working around 55 hours per week. Every week I shuck more than 1000 oysters. In Christmas, as the restaurant was busier than normal, we have been doing 250 covers a day, so that's means been shucking more than 400 oyster per day.
